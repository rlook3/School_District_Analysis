# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

We were asked to analyze the testing scores for schools in the district and report their performances in math and reading based on budget, size, and type. Thomas High School had to remove their ninth grade scores due to academic dishonesty and rerun their analysis.


## Results
After removing the THS ninth grade scores...
- the district summary shows slightly lower math scores and passing percentages.
- the school summary is mainly left unaffected except for the Thomas High School scores.
- Thomas HS actually improved their math and reading scores and passing percentages relative to the rest of the district.
- the math and reading scores by grade isn't affected because the 9th grade scores at THS were simply removed.
- the math and reading scores by school spending wasn't affected much since the scores removed only made up a small portion.
- the math and reading scores by school size wasn't affected much since the scores removed only made up a small portion.
- the math and reading scores by school type wasn't affected much since the scores removed only made up a small portion.

## Summary
Because much of the data didn't see much change after removing the THS ninth grade scores, it can be determined that they scored near the averages already shown on each summary. Since the scores and percentages slightly dropped, we can even determine that their scores were slightly above the THS/district averages. However removing such a small portion of the overall quantity of scores wasn't enough to drastically affect the outcome (outside of Thomas High School's individual perfomance).
